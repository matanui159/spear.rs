# spear.rs
I changed my mind and abandoned this project.
However, I already took the crates.io name and can't delete crates
(see https://github.com/rust-lang/crates.io/issues/166).
Sorry to anyone who comes across this project because they wanted the spear name.

I may come back to this later if I change my mind again.
